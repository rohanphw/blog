## Hey ðŸ‘‹

If you are here, you probably know who I am but still I'm a 21-year-old student, builder, and professional meme connoisseur, contributing to and most importantly making money out of decentralization, a serial shitposter on X. I have previously built on Tezos, Celo, Arbitrum, Moonbeam and
other EVM chains, currently trying to break into the Solana space (love the community).

> I'm Gilfoyle's energy trapped in Erlich's body, who's trying to become Richard Hendricks.

I have been building in the web3 space for last 2 years. I have worked on multiple projects in both evm and non-evm chains like Tezos. I have previously worked at [Tezos India](https://tezosindia.org.in) (2022-23) and [Cypherock](https://www.cypherock.com/)(early 2023). I have won multiple national and international hackathons and grants for my contributions. I recently got into UC Berkeley as an exchange student.

My goals to achieve are -

* Get better at my smart contracts and tokenomics skills and provide some value to DeFi.

* Take [c3labs](https://c3labs.fyi) to the moon ðŸš€.
